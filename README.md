# Gamer Union Bot

This bot is developed and maintained for the Gamer Union Discord by Razboy20.  

## To Install

To install, first clone the repository, then create a file `.env` in the directory. Then, the .env file should include the following filled out:

```pf
GOOGLE_API_KEY=""
SECRET_TOKEN=""
```

This allows the bot to know what to do. (For the Google API Key, it needs Youtube API perms to work.)

## Addons

Currently, the bot has the ability to support addons, and to create one, first take a look at the `example.js` addon, then if you create an addon, you can create your own reposity and add a pull request to the Addon branch of this repository.
